#This file contains the Nodes for bayesian network analysis

#Provide only probabilities when current state is true (including k nodes)
#
#Always use decimal point in probability, ex: 1.0
#First Line we declare all the nodes that the network will have
#
#After the declaration @! we type the probabilities we want to calculate
#Ex: P(-Sick!Loses), P(Dry),â€¦
